Waterloo Tools
==============

About
-----

This is a wesite which manages a collection of tools for University of Waterloo students
made by other students. Any edits are welcome! Drag to change
the order! Edits will be reviewed by an admin and then accepted 
and made active. At any time anyone can view all 
the submitted revisions by clicking on the Revisions button.

Steal my code!
--------------

If you are not a Waterloo student, you are free to use this code for your own school!
It's really easy. It will (probably) run on any server with PHP 4.
Just please contrinute back any enhancements that you make :)

Contribute
----------

See doc.html for the documented JavaScript code behind the editor.

If you would like to contribute to this site, you can take on 
one of the following tasks:

- Make me a logo :D
- Make things look better
- Make more of the site use mustache. Attach actions to 
  add/delete buttons after rendering them, not during the render.
- Make pressing the enter button submit the dialog boxes.
- Make it possible for an admin to delete a revision.
- The edit dialogs should only be rendered once on refresh 
  and then when the edit buttons are pressed, they should simply populate the values of the inputs inside the dialog.
