    <div>Greetings traveler, <br/>Thank you for your interest in this site. This site is built by <a href="http://viktorstanchev.com">Viktor Stanchev</a>. I believe in openness, so you
    may take a look at the front end <a href="doc.html">source code with nice comments</a> if you wish. The backend will be
    closed source for now, but I intend to publish everything on github later on.</div>
